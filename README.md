# Snake
Building a game of snake
Find the Figjam of how I want it to look as well as any kind of notes during my thinking process at <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/g2zG4PXhpfXFSK80KLnGu7/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1">Figma</a>
Day 1: Set up the HTML, CSS, and JS canvas
Day 2: Set up the snake and food
Day 3: Set up the game loop
Day 4: Set up the game logic
Day 5: Set up the game over logic
Day 6: Set up the game reset logic
Day 7: Set up the game pause logic
Day 8: Set up the game score logic
Day 9: Set up the game high score logic

Once everything is working, my goal is to make the snake Izzy (the 1996 mascot of the Atlanta Olympics) and have him pick up peaches. Each additional peach will add a lightning bolt to Izzy.
