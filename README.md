# Snake
Building a game of snake
Find the Figjam of how I want it to look as well as any kind of notes during my thinking process at <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/g2zG4PXhpfXFSK80KLnGu7/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1">Figma</a>

Day 1: Set up the HTML, CSS, and JS ✔️

Day 2: Set up the snake, and Canvas ✔️

Day 3: Make Snake Move

Day 4: Make Snake move via key presses (via KeyboardEvent)

day 5: Set up Food & have it randomly appear (math.floor(random() * (max - min) + min) for how to have the food show up over the canvas? Maybe?) ✔️ (whoops went ahead of myself)

Day 6: Make Snake grow ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) (collisionDetection()?)

Day 7: Set up the game over logic

Day 8: Set up the game reset logic

Day 9: Set up the game pause logic

Day 10: Set up the game score logic (function DrawScore())

Day 11: Set up the game high score logic

Once everything is working, my goal is to make the snake Izzy (the 1996 mascot of the Atlanta Olympics) and have him pick up peaches. Each additional peach will add a lightning bolt to Izzy.
